	<p>
		I am mostly interested in finding sources of friction and eliminating those.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fascinated by things that are slow, broken or unpredictable.<br>
		This spans technical area's but also includes things like human processes and workflows.

	<h2>Things</h2>

	<h3>CSS</h3>

	<h4>W3C Invited Expert</h4>

	<p>As a result of my work on CSS Color specifications I became an invited expert at the W3C for the CSS WG.</p>

	<h4>CSS Color</h4>

	<p>
		Created implementations for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/">css-color-4</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-5/">css-color-5</a>.

		<ul>
			<li>worked together with the specification editors to improve the specification texts</li>
			<li>contributed various new tests and fixes to WPT</li>
			<li>created PostCSS transpilation plugins based on these implementations</li>
			<li>still advocating for browser vendors to implement these features correctly</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4>Media Queries</h4>

	<p>
		Advocated for media queries as a broad focus area for <a href="https://web.dev/interop-2023/">interop 2023</a>.<br>
		I added various tests to WPT to illustrate the various interop issues and gaps in implementations.<br>
		This was accepted and all browsers now have greatly improved support for media queries.
	</p>

	<p>
		Improved support for modern media query features in various developer tools.

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/packages/media-query-list-parser">media query parser</a></li>
			<li>improved support for media <a href="https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugins/postcss-media-minmax#readme">range syntax in PostCSS</a></li>
			<li>improved static analysis of media queries in <a href="https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/media-query-no-invalid/">Stylelint</a></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4>CSS Tokenizer and Parsers</h4>

	<p>
		Created a specification compliant CSS tokenizer and various parsers.

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/packages/css-tokenizer">CSS tokenizer</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/romainmenke/css-tokenizer-tests">re-usable tests for CSS tokenizers</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/packages/css-parser-algorithms"> CSS parser algorithms</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/packages/media-query-list-parser">media query parser</a></li>
		</ul>

		These tools drive much of the new PostCSS plugins and are also used in projects like Stylelint.
	</p>

	<h4>PostCSS Preset Env</h4>

	<p>
		I took over maintenance for <a href="https://preset-env.cssdb.org/">PostCSS Preset Env</a> (together with <a href="https://antonio.laguna.es">Antonio Laguna</a>).<br>
		<ul>
			<li>migrated everything to a monorepo</li>
			<li>resolved all open issues and bug reports</li>
			<li>massively increased test coverage</li>
			<li>automated the release process</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4>CSS Bundlers</h4>
	
	<p>
		Created a specification compliant CSS bundler around @import and a shared test suite to drive interop between CSS bundlers.
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugin-packs/postcss-bundler">A CSS bundler for PostCSS</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/romainmenke/css-import-tests">tests for CSS bundlers</a></li>
	</ul>
	
		The test suite has also helped others like esbuild in finding and resolving various bugs.
	</p>

	<h4>Stylelint</h4>

	<p>
		Contributed various core rules to Stylelint and improved general performance by Â±30%.
	</p>

	<h4>VSCode</h4>

	<p>
		Contributed various features to the built-in CSS language support.
	</p>

	<hr>

	<h3>polyfill-library</h3>
	
	<p>
		Redefined how polyfills are tested for <a href="https://github.com/mrhenry/polyfill-library">polyfill-library</a>.<br>
		Originally polyfills were tested only in isolation, which led to various bugs when polyfills interacted.<br>
		I also fixed most of the bugs that were surfaced by these new tests.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Contributed various polyfills to <a href="https://github.com/mrhenry/polyfill-library">polyfill-library</a> and still
		help to maintain it.
	</p>
	
	<h4>core-web</h4>
	
	<p>
		I maintain <a href="https://github.com/mrhenry/core-web">core-web</a>, which is the same set of polyfills from
		polyfill-library, but injected through babel.<br>
	</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<h3>Browser Compat</h3>
	
	<p>
		Regular contributor to <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">MDN Browser Compat Data.</a><br>
		I also created <a href="https://github.com/mrhenry/web-tests">web-tests</a> as a way to quickly gather historical
		support
		data for various web features.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I advocated for something less biased and more inclusive than the first iteration of MDN/Google Baseline.<br>
		As part of this work I interacted with the community group to share my insights both as the maintainer of countless
		polyfills and as a web developer with a specific focus on supporting older browser versions.<br>
		The current definition (30 months since interop) aligns much more closely with end user needs and is much more
		inclusive.
	</p>
